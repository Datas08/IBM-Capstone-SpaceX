# IBM-Capstone-SpaceX
#### Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.   In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline  to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.

Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:

#### Most unsuccessful landings are planed. Space X; performs a controlled landing in the oceans.
